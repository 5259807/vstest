# Getting Started With Test Platform

## What is Test Platform?

``Visual Studio Test Platform (TP)`` - is a platform which allows you to write, execute and debug tests inside your testing project. Additionally TP is the runner and engine that powers test explorer and vstest.console.
Which means that you can run your tests in [Test Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2019) inside Visual Studio as well as with the help of [vstest.console.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/vstest-console-options?view=vs-2019) command.

## Which functionality provided by Test Platform?

1. Run tests from the specified files.
2. Target platform architecture to be used for test execution.
3. Target .NET version to be used for test execution.
4. Filter tests based on some expression.
5. Enable logging during the execution.
6. [Code Coverage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/using-code-coverage-to-determine-how-much-code-is-being-tested?view=vs-2019) - determine what proportion of your project's code is actually being tested by available tests.
